# Progress

## 6 / 27

* Finished Montygomery reductions
* passing tests
* only reduces for multiplication (and old montgomery algorithm)
* uses modular reduction and division rather than bit shifts

## TODO
* improve montgomery implementation (bit shifts)
* collect time data 
  * create standard test benchmark for comparison
* next:
  * fix paper after SwapQQ updates
    * swap section
	* fix spiral derivation
	* add example derivations (between implementation and results)
	  * Negative wrapped convolution
	  * Seiler
	  * Simple identity
  * start on inverse and point-wise multiplication
  
## Timeline
* finish implementation and collect results in next three weeks
* by 7/21 have results and paper done, 
* start working on defense: schedule with Sanjay
