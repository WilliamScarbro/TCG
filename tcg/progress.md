# Progress


## 6/12
(restarted)

### Goals:
#### Code base

0. Rebase
   * Improve documentation
	 * how to run
	 * how to test
   * extract necessary elements to own github project
   * streamline execution
   
1. complete compilation directly to C 
   * replace inermediate kernels with inline code
   * add efficient modular reductions (Montgomery's trick)
	 * hopefully do this in a modular way (one compiler pass)
  
2. add normalize transformation
   * validate / test

3. add pointwise multiplication and inverse operation
   * test
   * should not require modification of compiler 
   
#### Paper
1. rewrite results section using new compilation pathway
2. improve related work
   * find papers
   * relate to our work
   
### Current State:
